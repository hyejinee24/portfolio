Yeah,
Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty
But I hit right back
'cause you got that that, yeah
Why you always wanna act like lovers
But you never wanna be each other's
I say don't look back but I go right back and
All the sudden I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
You turn me on like a light switch
When your moving
your body around and around
Now I don't wanna fight this (No)
You know how to just make me want you
turn me on like a light switch
When your moving
your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (Yeah)
You know how to just make me
want you, baby
Do you love it when you keep me guessing?
When you leave and then you
leave me stressing?
But I cant stay mad
when you walk like that, no
Why you always wanna act like lovers
But you never wanna be each other's
I say don't look back but I go right back and
All a sudden I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
You turn me on like a light switch
When your movin'
your body around and around
No, I don't wanna fight this (No)
You know how to just make me want you
You turn me on like a light switch (Switch)
When your movin'
your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (Grip)
You know how to just make me
want you, baby
